correct labelling errors
	dh- noise
	
clustering for unsupervised approach

add thumb
use co-ordinates of (all) joints instead of angles

pose estimation error correction by restricting poses considering DoF

## TODO:
 - Fix rotations, instead of x, y, z, take a frame with respective to hand (like pitch and yoke) - done
 - Fix size normalization
 - Refactor training and testing flows to introduce abstraction on features
 - a. Recheck with angles, with ego hands and with 2 dof for thumb
   b. fix limb size change issue when angle changes and test with vertices
   select what to first -a or -b

1. Use coordinates (flattened) and euclidian distance to get the nearest neighbour (out of labelled signs)
2. Use statistical inference to improve reference poses (use ego hands to model distribution)
