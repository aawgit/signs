correct labelling errors
	dh- noise
	
clustering for unsupervised approach

add thumb
use co-ordinates of (all) joints instead of angles

pose estimation error correction by restricting poses considering DoF

## TODO:
 - Fix rotations, instead of x, y, z, take a frame with respective to hand (like pitch and yoke) - done
 - Fix size normalization - b. fix limb size change issue when angle changes and test with vertices

 - Refactor training and testing flows to introduce abstraction on features - almost done
 - a. Recheck with angles, with ego hands and with 2 dof for thumb

 use coordinates of fingers relative to finger base instead of absolute coordinates

1. Use coordinates (flattened) and euclidian distance to get the nearest neighbour (out of labelled signs)
2. Use statistical inference to improve reference poses (use ego hands to model distribution)
